        <p class="lead">
          AI is not most useful when it “summarizes everything.” It is most useful when it forces real learning:
          practice, feedback, and smarter review schedules. This post is my simple system for using AI like a tutor,
          backed by research from learning science.
        </p>

        <h3>1) The two study moves that consistently work</h3>
        <ul class="list list-fancy">
          <li><strong>Practice testing (retrieval practice)</strong>: recalling info from memory beats rereading for long-term retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Spaced practice</strong>: spreading study out over time improves retention compared to cramming.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In a major review of learning techniques, practice testing and spaced practice are rated as high-utility
          strategies across subjects and student types. (That means they work in lots of real situations, not just one class.)
        </p>

        <h3>2) Why “testing yourself” beats rereading</h3>
        <p>
          The “testing effect” is simple: when you force your brain to retrieve information, you strengthen the memory.
          Research shows that taking tests during learning can improve later recall more than additional studying.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Why spacing matters (and how AI helps)</h3>
        <p>
          Spacing is not just a study tip — it is backed by large-scale evidence, including meta-analyses.
          The key idea: review the right things at the right time instead of repeating everything every night.
        </p>

        <h3>4) Why tutoring is so powerful — and why AI can imitate parts of it</h3>
        <p>
          One-to-one tutoring is consistently associated with large learning gains compared to conventional classroom instruction.
          You cannot have a human tutor 24/7, but you can use AI to imitate tutor behaviors:
          asking questions, adapting difficulty, and giving feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>5) Evidence that AI tutoring can improve learning</h3>
        <p>
          Recent controlled research has found that students can learn substantially more in less time using an AI tutor
          compared to an active learning class (in the studied setting). This does not mean “AI always wins,” but it supports
          the idea that tutor-style interaction can be effective when designed well.
        </p>

        <h3>My AI Study System (what I actually do)</h3>
        <p>
          I built this around one goal: keep me in <strong>interactive / constructive</strong> learning modes, not passive reading.
          (Learning tends to improve as engagement moves from passive → active → constructive → interactive.)
        </p>

            <div class="float-inner">
              <h4>Step A — “Tutor Mode” (retrieval practice)</h4>
              <p class="muted">
                Use AI to ask questions one at a time, wait for your answer, then correct you and explain why.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Quiz me on [topic]. Ask 10 questions one at a time. After each answer, tell me what I got right/wrong and why. Increase difficulty if I do well.</code></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="callout drop reveal">
            <div class="float-inner">
              <h4>Step B — “Make It Harder” (transfer + real-world use)</h4>
              <p class="muted">
                Do not stop at easy questions. Ask for a scenario or application so you can transfer the concept.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Make the next question harder and add a real-world scenario. Then explain the best reasoning path, not just the answer.</code></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="callout drop reveal">
            <div class="float-inner">
              <h4>Step C — “Weak-Spot Diagnosis” (targeted review)</h4>
              <p class="muted">
                After a short quiz, force the AI to identify your weak points and build a short plan.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Based on my answers, list my top 3 weak spots. Give me a 15-minute review plan and 6 practice questions focused only on those.</code></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="callout drop reveal">
            <div class="float-inner">
              <h4>Step D — “Spacing Schedule” (so I do not cram)</h4>
              <p class="muted">
                AI helps me schedule review so I actually revisit material. The goal is short, repeated sessions.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Create a spaced review schedule for the next 10 days (10–20 minutes/day). Tell me exactly what to review each day and include 3 retrieval questions daily.</code></p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>My guardrails (so AI helps instead of hurting)</h3>
        <ul class="list list-fancy">
          <li><strong>No blind trust:</strong> when facts matter, I verify with class materials or reliable sources.</li>
          <li><strong>No copy-paste answers:</strong> I use AI to generate questions, feedback, and practice — not final submissions.</li>
          <li><strong>Explain the reasoning:</strong> I ask for the reasoning path and common mistakes, not just conclusions.</li>
        </ul>
