      <h2>A simple AI workflow for daily productivity</h2>
      <p class="date">January 24, 2026</p>

      <p>
        Productivity tools can get complicated fast, so I am starting with one small workflow: planning my
        day in a way that is realistic. The goal is not to do more tasks. The goal is to finish the right
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is the workflow:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Brain dump (2 minutes).</strong><br />
        I list everything on my mind: homework, errands, messages, and deadlines.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2: Ask AI to prioritize (1 minute).</strong><br />
        Prompt: “Here is my list. Ask 3 quick questions to clarify deadlines and effort. Then give me a
        plan with 3 priorities and a time-block schedule for today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3: Make the plan smaller (1 minute).</strong><br />
        Prompt: “Cut this plan down to the minimum that still counts as a successful day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I like this approach because it forces clarity (what matters today?) and it protects my time by
        keeping the plan short. If I keep using it, I will adjust the prompts until they match my actual
        schedule.
