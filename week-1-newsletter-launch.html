      <h2>Week 1: Newsletter launch, GitHub Pages, and what I learned</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        This week was about getting set up and actually publishing. The main lesson was that “live” is not automatic.
        You have to build the files correctly and make sure the homepage links everything.
      </p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Here is what we covered: getting started with GitHub, using AI as a coding partner, building the newsletter files,
        and deploying to GitHub Pages. Then we used a checklist to confirm everything worked.
      </p>

      <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1) Repository setup matters.</strong><br />
        GitHub Pages is picky about structure. The homepage must be named <code>index.html</code> and it must exist in the
        place your Pages settings point to (usually the repo root).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2) AI is more useful when you give it structure.</strong><br />
        Instead of “make me a website,” it worked better to ask for specific files and required elements like a post list,
        correct filenames, and consistent links.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3) Publishing is two steps.</strong><br />
        Step 1 makes the post file exist.<br />
        Step 2 puts the post on the homepage so people can actually find it.
      </p>

      <h3>What I will do next</h3>
      <p>
        Next, I want to write shorter posts more consistently and keep improving how I use AI for studying and productivity
        without overcomplicating things.
