      <h2>AI study prompts that actually help</h2>
      <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>
        When people say they “use AI to study,” they often mean they ask for a summary and stop there.
        That can feel productive, but it is easy to forget the information later. A better approach is to
        use AI to create practice and feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are three prompts I plan to use this week:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>1) “Quiz me like a tutor.”</strong><br />
        Ask: “I am studying [topic]. Ask me 8 questions, one at a time. After each answer, tell me what I
        got right or wrong and why.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2) “Make it harder.”</strong><br />
        After a correct answer, ask: “Give me a harder version of that question” or “Add a real-world
        scenario where this concept applies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3) “Find my weak spots.”</strong><br />
        Ask: “Based on my answers, list the top 3 concepts I should review and suggest a 10-minute plan.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The main idea is simple: use AI to generate active recall practice, not just a recap. If the tool
        helps you test yourself and fix mistakes, you are more likely to remember the material.
