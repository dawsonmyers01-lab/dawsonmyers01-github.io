        </div>

        <p class="lead">
          The best way I have found to use AI for studying is not asking it to summarize. The real value is using it
          like a tutor that keeps pushing you until you actually understand. This is the workflow I use when I want
          to learn something and not forget it a day later.
        </p>

        <h3>My rule for using AI when I study</h3>
        <p>
          If I am not answering questions, explaining ideas, or fixing mistakes, I am probably not learning much.
          So I use AI to force me into active studying instead of passive reading.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Warm up with fast questions</h3>
        <p>
          I start with quick questions to see what I know already. The goal is to find gaps early.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Quiz me on [topic]. Ask 8 questions one at a time. Wait for my answer each time. After I answer, tell me what I got right or wrong and why.</code></p>

        <h3>Step 2: Make it harder on purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Once I get a few right, I tell the AI to raise the difficulty. This is where I actually improve.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Make the next questions harder. Add one real world scenario question and one trick question. Explain the reasoning after each answer.</code></p>

        <h3>Step 3: Force me to explain, not just pick an answer</h3>
        <p>
          Multiple choice is fine, but explaining is better. If I cannot explain it, I do not really know it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Ask me to explain the concept in my own words in 3 sentences. Then point out what is missing or incorrect and give me a better version.</code></p>

        <h3>Step 4: Make a quick review plan so I do not cram</h3>
        <p>
          The last step is turning it into a short plan that I can actually follow this week.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>Based on what I missed, make a 7 day review plan. Keep it 10 to 20 minutes a day. Include 3 short retrieval questions each day.</code></p>

        <h3>Why this is also a productivity thing</h3>
        <p>
          This saves time because I stop wasting energy on stuff I already know. AI helps me aim my studying at what
          I am weak at, and it keeps my plan simple so I do not overthink it.
        </p>

        <h3>What I am going to try next</h3>
        <p>
          Next week I want to test this workflow on a real class unit and track how many questions I can answer
          correctly at the start versus the end. If it works, I will keep building a repeatable system for every class.
